        <p>LiveWire, the electric motorcycle division of Harley-Davidson, launched the third model in its portfolio this week, the S2 Mulholland. The new model is based on the same platform as the S2 Del Mar and will only be available in the United States and Canada for now, priced at $15,999 (around R$80,000 with current exchange rates).

          The Mulholland features a distinct design compared to the Del Mar, though it still falls into the same cruiser category. The seat and handlebars appear higher, and the tail section is shorter. It comes with 19’’ wheels in the front and 17’’ in the back.
          
          To power the bike, there’s an 84 hp electric motor with 26.2 kgfm of torque, fueled by a 10.5 kWh battery. The Mulholland reaches 100 km/h in the same time as a Porsche 911 Carrera 4 GTS: 3.3 seconds. However, the top speed is limited to 150 km/h. According to the manufacturer, the range is 195 km in the city and 118 km on highways, assuming a speed of just under 90 km/h. With fast charging, the battery can reach 80% in 78 minutes.
          
          One feature that distinguishes the S2 Mulholland is its aim to be a more "sustainable" motorcycle, due to the use of various recycled and eco-friendly materials in its construction. For instance, the radiator cover and other supports are made from Hylon Ocean, a material recycled from fishing nets found in the ocean. The seat also uses recyclable silicone instead of petroleum-based products.
          
          There is no expectation that LiveWire will sell its motorcycles in Brazil for the time being. However, starting next year, the brand plans to expand to markets beyond the United States and Canada.</p>

        <p>If someone asked you what is the first brand that comes to mind when we talk about custom motorcycles, what would you say? Most likely, Harley-Davidson would be one of your options.

          When it comes to custom motorcycles, this brand stands out as an icon, synonymous with freedom, style, and power on the road. It’s almost a religion!
          
          Founded in 1903 in the United States, Harley-Davidson is not just a motorcycle brand; it’s a living legend that has spanned decades, shaped motorcycle culture, and won the hearts of millions of motorcycle enthusiasts around the world.
          
          In today’s article, we’re going to talk a bit more about the origins of Harley-Davidson and the impact it has had on world history. Follow along!
          
          Harley-Davidson: A Lifestyle
          
          What is the origin of the Harley-Davidson brand?
          The story of Harley-Davidson began in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, when two young visionary entrepreneurs, William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson, decided to join forces to create a motorcycle unlike anything that existed at the time.
          
          Harley-Davidson Serial Number 1
          In 1903, in the modest Davidson family shed, the first Harley-Davidson came to life. With a 3-horsepower engine and a robust frame, this first motorcycle laid the foundation for what would become one of the most iconic brands in history.
          
          In 1909, they introduced the iconic V-Twin engine, marking the start of an era of power and performance that would become a distinctive feature of the brand. This motorcycle marked the beginning of a journey that would transform Harley-Davidson into one of the most iconic and recognizable brands in the world.
          
          Arthur Davidson and William Harley
          The founders worked tirelessly to refine their designs and expand production, building a reputation for quality and durability. Over the decades, Harley-Davidson grew, faced challenges, and evolved, but the original vision of William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson left a lasting legacy in motorcycle history.
          
          The brand not only stood the test of time but also became a cultural icon and a symbol of freedom on the road.
          
          Since its creation, Harley-Davidson has always been at the forefront of innovation in the motorcycle world. Over the years, Harley-Davidson continued to evolve, introducing legendary models like the Knucklehead in the 1930s, the Panhead in the 1940s, the Shovelhead in the 1960s, the Sportster, Dyna, Fat Boy, and many others, which became instant classics.
          
          Harley-Davidson: The Brand that Impacted World History
          
          The brand’s adoption was so significant that Harley-Davidson made its mark on world history by becoming an important brand in wars, providing rugged and reliable motorcycles for military use.

          Its contribution was particularly notable during World War I and World War II.
          
          During World War I, Harley-Davidson supplied motorcycles to the United States Army. These bikes were used for various purposes, from patrolling to rapid communication on battlefields. The motorcycles’ ability to navigate varied terrain and their agility made them valuable to the war effort.
          
          Between the two World Wars, Harley-Davidson continued to supply motorcycles to the armed forces. Models like the JD and the VL were used in various capacities, including border patrol and military training.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Knuckle Head Culture: The Legacy of Custom Motorcycles and Freedom</h2>
    <p class="text-center">
      <hr>The Knuckle Head motorcycle culture refers to a vibrant and bold subculture in the custom motorcycle world, centered around the iconic Knucklehead engine from Harley-Davidson. Introduced in 1936, the Knucklehead was a milestone in motorcycle engineering, earning its nickname due to the shape of its valve covers resembling "knuckles." This engine quickly became a symbol of innovation and power, representing a rebellious and authentic lifestyle.
      
      The Knuckle Head community values motorcycle customization, combining creativity, tradition, and a spirit of freedom. Customizing a Knucklehead goes beyond mere aesthetic modifications; it’s a form of personal and cultural expression. Each bike carries a unique story, crafted by hands that understand the value of artisanal mechanics. Many enthusiasts dedicate themselves to restoring old parts or modifying classic models, keeping the legacy of the Knucklehead engine alive while adding modern and exclusive touches.
      
      For fans, being part of the Knuckle Head culture is more than just riding a motorcycle; it’s embracing a free lifestyle, focused on the open road, brotherhood, and a commitment to authenticity. The roar of the Knucklehead engine, custom motorcycle shows, and the collaborative spirit are the pillars of this subculture that spans generations.</p>
